# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification with Linear Regression 🌸
Welcome to the **Iris Flower Classification** project! 🎉 This repository contains a detailed implementation of a machine learning model that classifies Iris flowers into three species—Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica—using Linear Regression. Whether you're new to machine learning or a seasoned pro, this project offers a clear example of the end-to-end process of building a classification model.

## 📚 Project Overview
The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in machine learning, featuring 150 samples of iris flowers. Each sample includes four features, which are used to classify the flowers into one of three species. Here’s a closer look at the dataset:

### 🌟 Dataset Features
1. **Sepal Length** (cm)
   - The length of the sepal, which is the outer part of the flower.
2. **Sepal Width** (cm)
   - The width of the sepal.
3. **Petal Length** (cm)
   - The length of the petal, which is the colorful part of the flower.
4. **Petal Width** (cm)
   - The width of the petal.

## 🚀 Getting Started
### Prerequisites
To run the notebooks and the code, you need:
- Python 3.6 or later
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries (listed in `requirements.txt`)

### Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zhordiffallah/iris-flower-classification.git
   cd iris-flower-classification
   ```

2. **Install the required libraries:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   Navigate to the `Iris Flower Classification` directory and open `Iris_Classification_Linear_Regression.ipynb`.

## 🔍 Project Steps

1. **Data Exploration**: Understand the dataset through visualizations and statistical summaries.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, encode categorical data, and scale features.
3. **Model Training**: Train a Linear Regression model on the training set.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
5. **Model Saving**: Save the trained model for future use.


## 🔮 Future Work

Consider these improvements and extensions:

- Experiment with advanced models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or Neural Networks.
- Engage in feature engineering to enhance model performance.
- Implement cross-validation for more robust evaluation.
